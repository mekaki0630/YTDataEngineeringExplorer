YTDataEngineeringExplorer: Analytics Dashboard for YouTube Data

Project Overview
This project entailed the creation of an analytics dashboard, specifically tailored for the management and analysis of YouTube video data. A key focus was to ensure a secure and efficient process for handling a variety of data types, including both structured and semi-structured data. The dashboard was designed to effectively organize data based on video categories and trending metrics, facilitating a comprehensive overview of YouTube analytics.

Project Goals and Execution Strategy
To achieve the project's objectives, I employed several AWS services:

Amazon S3: This service was used for scalable storage solutions, accommodating the expansive nature of video data.
AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management): This tool was crucial for managing secure access to the data and services.
AWS Glue: A serverless data integration service that was utilized for effective ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
AWS Lambda: This service enabled running code for efficient data transformation, crucial for handling diverse data formats.
AWS Athena: Employed for querying data stored in S3, facilitating a seamless data retrieval process.
QuickSight: Chosen for BI (Business Intelligence) reporting, offering dynamic and insightful data visualization capabilities.
The execution strategy encompassed several key phases:

Data Ingestion: Developed a mechanism to seamlessly ingest data from various sources into AWS.
ETL System: Transformed raw data into a usable format by leveraging AWS services.
Data Lake Creation: Established a centralized data repository in AWS S3, accommodating diverse data sources.
Scalability and Cloud Integration: Focused on scalability within AWS to effectively process large datasets.
Reporting: Built a dynamic dashboard using QuickSight for comprehensive data analysis and reporting.
Data Transformation Processes
The project involved intricate data transformation processes:

Raw Data Management: Configured AWS S3 buckets for data storage, utilizing AWS Glue for effective data cataloging.
Data Analysis and Transformation: Utilized AWS Athena and AWS Lambda for processing JSON formatted data, converting it into a clean, query-able format.
CSV Data Handling: Implemented crawlers for CSV data ingestion, focusing on data preprocessing and transformation into a more efficient Parquet format.
Business Intelligence Reporting: Employed QuickSight for advanced data visualization, providing valuable business intelligence insights.
